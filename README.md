## Mobileye-Project
In this project we developed an algorithm to detect any traffic lightsand their distance with in a givven video.

The project is consisted of 4 parts:
##### part1:
Detection of source lights in an image using convolution with customized
high- and low-pass filters.
##### part2
Generating and training CNN using the previous stage as input, to conclude
all the traffic lights in the image (using tensorflow).
##### part3
Estimating the distance to each detected traffic light from the camera picturing
the images of interest, involving geometric and linear algebra calculations.
###### part4
Integrating all previous parts into a functional and intuitive SW product.

### Technologies used:
- python
- jupyter
- image proccesing and machine learning
- tensorflow.keras
- numpy
- matplotlib

### Special Thanks
to all mobileye members who helped us through this project, 
if you were a lecturer - who taught us the material in an amaizing way,
or if were a mentor who helped us with any questains we had.
